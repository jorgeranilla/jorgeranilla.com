                <p><strong>Hello, I’m Jorge.</strong></p>

                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Peru and moved to the United States at a young age in search
                    of new opportunities and growth. Over time, this country became home, and I am proud
                    to be American by choice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Professionally, I work in the banking and operations field, where I value structure,
                    accountability, and continuous improvement. I enjoy solving problems, improving
                    processes, and taking pride in doing things the right way. Learning has always been
                    important to me, whether through formal education, hands-on experience, or simply
                    figuring things out along the way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work, family comes first. I am a husband and a dad, and I deeply value the
                    time spent with the people I love. This website reflects that. It is a place to
                    preserve memories, share updates, and document our journey together as a growing
                    family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures. These experiences have shaped how
                    I see the world and helped me appreciate different perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This site is meant to be simple and personal. It serves as a digital home for both my
                    professional path and my family’s story.
