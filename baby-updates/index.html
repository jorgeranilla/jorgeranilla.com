                    <p>I have some great news! Since early this morning and throughout the afternoon there have been no
                        contractions. Shane continues to have a good appetite, and Baby Alyssa continues to have a
                        reassuring heartbeat. Today the doctors reevaluated Shane and decided she can be discharged.</p>
                    <p>The doctors explained that she has already received the full course of betamethasone (the
                        steroid injections) to help mature Alyssa's lungs. Because that treatment is complete, it
                        generally cannot be given again. For that reason, if she is readmitted and labor progresses,
                        they would likely allow the delivery to continue.</p>
                    <p>She was sent home on strict bed rest until the 24th. After that, she may slowly return to normal
                        activities with some restrictions.</p>
                    <p>We understand this is still a high-risk pregnancy and delivery could happen at any time, but
                        there is also a real possibility we can gain more weeks, which would be very beneficial for her.
                    </p>
                    <p>We continue trusting in God and ask you to please keep Shane and Baby Alyssa in your prayers.
                        She is a strong and very brave little girl.</p>
                    <p>We will keep you updated.</p>

                    <p>Shane was finally able to get a full night of rest and woke up in much better spirits. The
                        doctors also removed her restricted clear-liquid diet, which was another encouraging step. She
                        is more relaxed and continues to show good signs of stability.</p>
                    <p>We are very thankful for everyone's prayers and support. Each hour that passes is very important,
                        as it gives baby Alyssa's lungs more time to mature and prepare for when she decides to arrive.
                    </p>

                    <p>During the night the medical team began adjusting Shane's care as part of the plan. Since her
                        condition had stabilized, they were able to stop the magnesium medication and IV fluids while
                        continuing to monitor her progress.</p>
                    <p>They also moved her from the labor bed to a more comfortable antepartum bed, which she
                        immediately appreciated. The catheter was removed and the continuous fetal monitoring was no
                        longer needed, a reassuring sign that things had calmed down.</p>
                    <p>Overall, Shane was showing very encouraging progress.</p>
                    <p>For me, this was also the first night I was finally able to get some rest after being awake the
                        entire previous night. It felt like a small moment of relief for both of us.</p>

                    <p>We shared an update with our relatives and asked them to keep Shane and Alyssa in their prayers.

                    <p>In the evening Shane was checked again by the doctor. At that time she was resting comfortably
                        and no longer feeling contractions. Baby Alyssa was moving well and her heartbeat continued to
                        look strong and reassuring on the monitor.</p>
                    <p>The medical team explained that the medications were doing their job. Shane continued receiving
                        magnesium through the night while the steroid treatment for Alyssa's lungs completed its 24-hour
                        course. After that, the plan would be to carefully stop the medication and continue observing
                        her in the hospital.</p>
                    <p>This was very encouraging news for us, as it showed that the labor had slowed down and both mom
                        and baby were stable. We were able to rest a little easier knowing things had become calmer.</p>

                    <p>That afternoon my brother Victor surprised us by coming all the way from Charlotte. He made the
                        2½-hour drive just to spend some time with us, which meant a lot. He brought flowers, a
                        handwritten letter, and some food to share, and his visit truly lifted our spirits.</p>
                    <p>We spent a very special time together talking, asking questions, and simply keeping each other
                        company. We were also able to connect with María and my parents over a video call so everyone
                        could be part of the moment.</p>
                    <p>Victor was able to see the NICU area where Alyssa would stay after birth while she grows stronger
                        and prepares to come home. Seeing it helped all of us feel more at peace about the care she will
                        receive.</p>
                    <p>Although we offered for him to stay the night, he chose to drive back home to take care of other
                        commitments. We were deeply grateful he came just to be with us during this unexpected time.</p>
                    <p>Thank you, Victor, for your love and support — it meant more to us than we can express.</p>

                    <p>During the afternoon we made the difficult decision to cancel the baby shower that had been
                        planned for February 22.</p>
                    <p>Because Shane is now 4 cm dilated, the doctors consider her pregnancy high-risk and she will
                        remain in the hospital under observation until delivery. For that reason, it became clear that
                        we would not be able to hold the celebration as originally planned.</p>
                    <p>Out of respect for everyone's time and travel plans, we informed all guests through the event
                        page and personal messages so no one would make unnecessary arrangements.</p>
                    <p>This was not an easy decision for us. We were very much looking forward to celebrating Alyssa's
                        upcoming arrival with all of you. However, right now our priority is Shane's rest and care, and
                        for me to remain by her side.</p>

                        and baby Alyssa safe.</p>

                    <p>Later that morning we met with the Neonatology (NICU) team. They came to prepare us in case
                        Alyssa decides to arrive early. This is a routine visit whenever a baby may be born premature,
                        and it was mostly an educational and reassuring conversation.</p>
                    <p>They explained that babies born around 33 weeks generally do very well, but they are still a
                        little early and may need some temporary help while they finish developing outside the womb.</p>
                    <p>Some of the things we discussed:</p>
                    <p>• Breathing support:<br>
                        Her lungs are still maturing, so she may need a little oxygen or a small breathing support mask
                        (similar to a gentle air flow through the nose). This is common for babies at this age and often
                        only needed for a short period.</p>
                    <p>• Feeding:<br>
                        Even though she will be able to swallow, premature babies do not yet fully coordinate sucking,
                        swallowing, and breathing. Because of this, she may first receive milk through a small feeding
                        tube that goes through the nose into the stomach (a nasogastric tube). This helps her grow and
                        gain strength until she is ready to breastfeed or bottle feed safely.</p>
                    <p>• Temperature and growth:<br>
                        She may stay in a warm incubator at first because premature babies have trouble keeping their
                        body temperature stable and burn calories quickly.</p>
                    <p>• Monitoring:<br>
                        The NICU team will continuously monitor her heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels while she
                        adapts to life outside the womb.</p>
                    <p>They also explained that most babies at this stage stay in the hospital mainly to grow, learn to
                        feed on their own, and gain strength. Many are ready to go home closer to 37–38 weeks once they
                        can maintain their temperature, eat normally, and continue gaining weight.</p>
                    <p>The team was very kind and patient with us. We were able to ask many questions, and the
                        conversation helped us understand what to expect. While this is not how we imagined these weeks,
                        we felt reassured knowing there is a clear plan and a team ready to care for Alyssa.</p>

                    <p>Shane was evaluated by the doctor in the morning. Since her water had not broken and she was
                        stable, they did not need to recheck her cervix and instead chose to continue gentle monitoring.
                        By this time the contractions had decreased significantly, which was a very encouraging sign.
                        The treatments appeared to be helping, and both Shane and baby Alyssa were doing well.</p>

                    <p>Shane was officially admitted at 33 weeks due to preterm labor. The doctors' goal is to safely
                        slow things down and give baby Alyssa as much extra time to grow as possible.</p>
                    <p>They began treatments to support Alyssa's development, including magnesium (to help protect her
                        brain and calm the contractions) and steroid injections to help her lungs mature. She received
                        the first injection around 1:00 AM, and a second dose was planned 24 hours later.</p>
                    <p>Shane is stable, comfortable, and receiving wonderful care. We feel very thankful for the doctors
                        and nurses who have been so attentive and reassuring.</p>

                        was already in early labor. Her OB physician was notified and came to the hospital. Shane was
                        admitted to the Labor & Delivery floor so they could closely monitor both her and baby Alyssa

                    <p>While waiting for the doctor to call back, we talked about which hospital to go to. The closest
                        hospital was only about 10 minutes away, but the hospital where Shane had been receiving her
                        pregnancy care and where we had planned for Alyssa's birth was WakeMed in Cary, about 35 minutes
                        from home. We decided it would be best for her doctors to have her full medical history, so we
                        started driving to WakeMed. Shortly after, the doctor returned our call and also advised going
                        to a hospital for evaluation. By then, we were already on our way.</p>

                        make sure we were doing the right thing. We wanted to be cautious and not ignore something

                    <p>Shane began feeling uncomfortable with contractions. At first we thought they might be Braxton
                        Hicks (practice contractions), but they started coming more regularly and stronger. We listened
                        to baby Alyssa's heartbeat with the small fetal doppler we have at home, and it sounded strong
                        and reassuring. We also checked Shane's blood pressure and it was normal. Even with rest and
                        plenty of water, the contractions continued through the evening.</p>
