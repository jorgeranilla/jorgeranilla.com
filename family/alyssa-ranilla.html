                    <p><strong>Our little miracle in the making. Arriving soon to fill our hearts with endless
                            love.</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Alyssa is currently growing safe and warm in mommy Shane's belly, and she's due to arrive
                        on April 5th.
                        Mom and Dad are counting down the days with hearts full of joy and anticipation, dreaming of the
                        moment they
                        finally get to hold her in their arms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We already know she's going to be extraordinary. Beautiful, with a smile that lights up every
                        room. Smart,
                        with a curious mind that will ask a thousand questions and seek out wonder in everything around
                        her. Kind,
                        with a heart that will touch everyone she meets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She'll grow up surrounded by love, supported by a family that believes in her limitless
                        potential. We can
                        already see her future: confident, accomplished, and full of grace. A woman who will make her
                        own path in
                        this world, who will dream big and achieve even bigger.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Alyssa, you are already so deeply loved. Your arrival will complete our family in ways we can
                        only begin to
                        imagine. We're ready for your laughter, your first steps, your first words, and every precious
                        milestone that
                        follows. You're going to be amazing, little one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Welcome to the world, sweet Alyssa. Your story is just beginning, and we can't wait to watch you
                        shine.
                    </p>
