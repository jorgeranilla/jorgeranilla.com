                    <p><strong>Steady, hardworking, and wise — our foundation and biggest supporter.</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        My father, Dr. Jorge Luis Ranilla Cateriano, is a surgeon specializing in Orthopedics and
                        Traumatology in Lima, Peru.
                        He's spent his entire career helping people recover from injuries and regain their mobility —
                        work that requires not just
                        medical skill, but deep compassion and patience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Early in his career, he worked during one of Peru's most difficult periods, treating patients in
                        rural areas and at the
                        National Police Hospital during the country's conflict with terrorist groups. He also spent time
                        at the San José Geriatric
                        Hospital, where he developed a special interest in degenerative conditions and learned to work
                        closely with geriatric specialists
                        to provide comprehensive care for older patients.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout his career, he's become an expert in diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal
                        conditions — from traumatic injuries
                        like fractures and joint damage to degenerative diseases. He performs complex procedures
                        including osteosynthesis, arthroplasty,
                        and arthroscopy, always focused on helping his patients regain function and improve their
                        quality of life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He's also trained in biological therapies, ozone therapy, and musculoskeletal ultrasound,
                        constantly updating his skills to
                        offer the best care possible. What sets him apart is his ethical, patient-centered approach — he
                        truly cares about each person's
                        recovery and well-being.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recognizing that some patients can't easily travel to a clinic, he also provides home medical
                        care for those with mobility
                        limitations or post-operative needs. Through his company, OSTEORAY SAC, he also supplies medical
                        equipment like C-arms and
                        flat panels to support other healthcare providers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To me, he's more than a skilled surgeon — he's the steady, dependable presence who taught me the
                        value of hard work, integrity,
                        and always putting others first. I'm incredibly proud to be his son.
                    </p>
