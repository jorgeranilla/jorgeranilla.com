                    <p><strong>Life, travel, and projects — collecting moments and building things that last.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Peru and moved to the United States at a young age in search of new
                        opportunities and growth.
                        Over time, this country became home, and I am proud to be American by choice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Professionally, I work in the banking and operations field, where I value structure,
                        accountability, and continuous improvement.
                        I enjoy solving problems, improving processes, and taking pride in doing things the right way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Outside of work, family comes first. I am a husband and a dad, and I deeply value the time spent
                        with the people I love.
                        This website reflects that. It is a place to preserve memories, share updates, and document our
                        journey together as a growing family.
                    </p>
