                    <p><em>Deceased | Great-Grandmother</em></p>

                    <p>
                        Lucila Dongo Salcedo was born in the district of Ocoña, belonging to the Province of
                        Camaná in Arequipa, Peru. She lost her parents when she was very young and together
                        with her brothers and sisters they were raised in Majes, far from where she was born.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite the hardships of her early years, Lucila grew into a devoted and resilient woman.
                        She dedicated herself entirely to her home and her family, and became the heart of
                        everything she built around her.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At just 17 years old she married Victoriano Cateriano, who was 22. Together in the
                        valleys of Arequipa they raised a family whose love and strength echo through
                        every generation that came after them.
                    </p>
