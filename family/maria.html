                    <p><strong>Creative, caring, and full of energy — the one who keeps everyone connected.</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Maria is my sister, and she's always been the one who brings people together. She works as a
                        Global CRM Manager in the fintech
                        industry, where she designs customer lifecycle strategies for the Spanish and Mexican markets.
                        Her work focuses on understanding
                        what customers need and creating experiences that make their lives easier — from the moment they
                        sign up to building long-term
                        relationships.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She's great at turning data into action, working with product, tech, analytics, and marketing
                        teams to align business goals with
                        real user needs. Throughout her career, she's worked on cross-functional projects in regulated
                        environments, helping develop and
                        optimize digital financial products. What drives her is finding practical ways to improve
                        customer journeys and build processes
                        that actually work and last.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Maria lives in Barcelona, Spain, where she balances her career with being a mom. Motherhood has
                        made her even more adaptable,
                        empathetic, and decisive — qualities that show up in everything she does, both personally and
                        professionally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When she's not working, she loves spending time with her family and their dog, exploring nature
                        through trekking and outdoor
                        adventures. They often take road trips together, seeking out experiences that keep them active
                        and connected. She values a
                        healthy lifestyle and meaningful moments that support both personal well-being and professional
                        balance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She's structured, thoughtful, and people-centered — always thinking about how to make things
                        better for everyone around her.
                        I'm lucky to have her as my sister.
                    </p>
