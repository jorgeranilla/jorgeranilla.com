          <p><strong>Hello, I'm Jorge.</strong></p>

          <p>
            I was born and raised in Peru and moved to the United States at a young age in search of new opportunities
            and growth.
            Over time, this country became home, and I am proud to be American by choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Professionally, I work in the banking and operations field, where I value structure, accountability, and
            continuous improvement.
            I enjoy solving problems, improving processes, and taking pride in doing things the right way.
            Learning has always been important to me, whether through formal education, hands-on experience, or simply
            figuring things out along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of work, family comes first. I am a husband and a dad, and I deeply value the time spent with the
            people I love.
            This website reflects that. It is a place to preserve memories, share updates, and document our journey
            together as a growing family.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy traveling and exploring new cultures. These experiences have shaped how I see the world and
            helped me appreciate different perspectives.
          </p>

          <p>
            This site is meant to be simple and personal. It serves as a digital home for both my professional path and
            my family's story.
