                    <p><strong>Thoughtful, sharp, and always learning — the calm problem-solver.</strong></p>

                    <p>
                        Victor is my younger brother, and he's someone I've always admired for his ability to stay calm
                        under pressure and think things through.
                        He works at Vanguard on the Trading Desk, where he helps people navigate everything from
                        Treasury bonds to stock trades and complex
                        investment decisions. What makes him great at his job is the same thing that makes him a great
                        brother — he knows how to break down
                        complicated things and make them easy to understand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Before getting into finance, Victor spent over a decade in the wellness world as a fitness
                        entrepreneur, wellness director, and
                        certified sports nutritionist. That background taught him how to coach people, motivate them,
                        and help them reach their goals —
                        skills he still uses every day when guiding clients through financial decisions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He's bilingual in English and Spanish, which helps him connect with a wide range of people. He
                        holds his Series 7, 63, 65, and SIE
                        licenses, along with certifications in sports nutrition and fitness training. But beyond all the
                        credentials, what stands out most
                        is how much he genuinely cares about helping people feel confident in their choices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Victor lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife Alessandra and their two dogs, Jasper
                        and Petunia. When he's not working,
                        you'll find them hiking, stand-up paddleboarding, trying new restaurants, or traveling to visit
                        friends and family. He's the kind
                        of person who values experiences over things and stays grounded in what really matters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He's methodical, strategic, and warm — always ready to help solve a problem or lend a listening
                        ear. I'm proud to call him my brother.
                    </p>
